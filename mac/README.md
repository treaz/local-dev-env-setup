# mac-dev-setup (alpha)
This dir was created after I installed my development environment on a new MacBook.

It was tested (after most of the software was installed) on macOS Mojave (10.14.2).

I assume that a clean install it should mostly work, but if it doesn't, just raise an issue, and I'll take care of it.

# Usage
Clone the repo and run any of the install_* or configure_* scripts
```
git clone https://github.com/treaz/mac-dev-setup
cd mac-dev-setup
./install_<feature>
./configure_os_settings.sh # configures macOS settings
./copy_config_files.sh #adds most commonly used settings files to home dir
```
